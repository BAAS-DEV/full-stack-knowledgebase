# Set Up Docker Desktop



## Windows 10/11 Tutorial

Here is a tutorial on how to set up Docker Desktop on Windows 10 or Windows 11:

1. First, you will need to download and install Docker Desktop for Windows. You can do this by going to the following link:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

1. Click on the "Get Docker Desktop for Windows" button to begin the download. Once the download is complete, double-click on the installer file to begin the installation process.

2. Follow the prompts to complete the installation process. This may include accepting the terms of service and specifying the installation location.

3. Once the installation is complete, open the Docker Desktop application.

4. Docker may prompt you to enable Hyper-V, which is a virtualization technology built into Windows. Click "Yes" to enable Hyper-V.

5. Docker will then prompt you to sign in to your Docker account. If you don't have a Docker account, you can create one by clicking on the "Create a Docker account" button.

6. After signing in to your Docker account, you should see the Docker Dashboard. From here, you can manage your Docker containers, images, and other resources.

That's it! You should now have Docker set up and ready to use on your Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine.

# What Is Tailwind?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style your applications without writing any custom CSS. Instead of predefined styles, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that you can use to apply styles directly to your HTML elements. This allows you to build up your design system in a more modular and flexible way.

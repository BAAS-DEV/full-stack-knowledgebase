# What is State?

In a React application, state is an object that represents the variables that can be modified in the application. It is an essential part of building a React application, as it allows components to dynamically change their output in response to user interactions or other events.

There are different forms of state in a React application:

- Local state: Local state is specific to a particular component, and is only accessible within that component. It is used to store data that is specific to the component and is not needed by any other component. Local state is often used to store data that is only needed for the internal logic of the component, such as form values or toggle states.

- Context state: Context state is a global state that can be accessed by any component in the application. It is useful for storing data that needs to be shared across multiple components, such as a user's authentication status or the selected theme.

- External Provider State: External providers (such as Redux) allows you to store all of your application's state in a single, immutable object, and provides a set of functions for updating the state in a predictable way. Redux state is useful for storing data that needs to be shared across the entire application, and for managing complex state updates.

It's important to choose the right form of state for your application based on the needs of your application and the type of data you are storing. Local state is useful for storing data that is specific to a single component, while context state and External Provider states are useful for storing data that needs to be shared across multiple components.
